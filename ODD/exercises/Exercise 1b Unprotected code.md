## Exercise 2a: Unprotected code

#### Goal

Investigate what happens when importing from modules with "unprotected" code.

#### Preparation

(none)

#### Tasks

0. Create a file in the `src/` folder called `unprotectd_code.py`.

1. Add a line in `unprotectd_code.py` that imports the `todays_special` function from `daily_menu.py`.

2. **BEFORE YOU EXECUTE THE FILE**. Discuss with your partner what you think will happen when you run `unprotectd_code.py`.

3. Run `unprotectd_code.py`. Does your prediction match reality?

4. (optional, for those who know) Discuss with your partner:
    * Why did this behaviour occur?
    * Why is it not good?
    * What can you do to "fix" the behaviour?
