## Exercise 3: Workflow

#### Goal

Experience that working with an editable installation does not change how you interact with your code. 
This is supposed to be easy and fun, so run the inspection often and make mistakes with the potion.

Use your git skills to commit the changes you made to a new branch, and create a pull request.


#### Tasks

- In the `make_pizzas.py` file add another function that makes your favourite pizza.

- Call this function from different places in your code
  - in the if __name__ == "__main__" part of the same file
  - add it to the tasting menu in the `scripts/run_pizza_restaurant.py` file
  - replace the margarita pizza in the `src/daily_menu.py` file with your pizza

-------------
#### Extra credit

Once you are done, reflect on what you did to find out what the cooking method was 
- Where did you look, why did you look there first?
- How did you figure out what it does? What part of the function did you read first?
- Did it work on your first try? If not, how did you try to fix it - trial and error or read documentation?
